# u80iso
tryna make a rama u80-a iso compatible. wish me luck.

LibreCAD was used to make the plate file

Started in KiCad 5.1.10, now in KiCad 7

I've been following the ai03 pcb design tutorial here https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide

currently in guide step 5 on building the pcb
https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-5---creating-the-pcb

in placing the controller and other circuit parts into the completed switch matrix, i noticed that what should be GND pins are reading as 5v instead. Bug? looking for feedback on this.

todo:
* fix above bug
* replace usb port with jst connector for the daughterboard
* tracing circuits
* silk screening for fun
