# u80iso
tryna make a rama u80-a iso compatible. wish me luck.

LibreCAD was used to make the plate file

KiCad 5.1.10 has been being used for pcb files.
I've been following the ai03 pcb design tutorial here https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide

currently in guide step 5 on building the pcb
https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-5---creating-the-pcb

in placing the controller and other circuit parts into the completed switch matrix, i noticed that what should be GND pins are reading as 5v instead. Bug? looking for feedback on this.

todo:
* fix above bug
* replace usb port with jst connector for the daughterboard
* tracing circuits
* silk screening for fun
